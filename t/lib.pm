#! perl

# t::lib is a convention I've adoted in my Perl test suites that seems
# to work out okay.  The idea is that every test starts with:
#
#    use t::lib;
#
# which sticks stuff into the main package and arranges to set up
# whatever environment the tests need: output directory, output files,
# working dir, blah blah.  Whatever.  The END {} block cleans up
# anything we do automatically when a test dies or wins.
